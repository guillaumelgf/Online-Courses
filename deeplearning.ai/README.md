# Machine Learning Exercices

These are all the personnal assignements that I did during the Machine Learning course. The .zip files are the original files.

## Exercise 1 : Linear Regression
The goal of this exercise is to build a Linear Regression algorithm from scratch and see it work on datas. First the exercise gives a quick tutorial on the way Octave works.  Then I had to implement **Gradient Descent**. A final optional exercise was implementing Linear Regression with **multiple variables**.
It includes **data vizualisation**, **debugging** and **feature normalization**.
## Exercise 2 :
